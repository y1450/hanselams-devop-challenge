# Python Google API Challenge

Our challenge is set in the context working with major platform APIs.
We want you to setup the API for Gmail and do some easy tasks with it.
(https://developers.google.com/gmail/api)


## Task

* setup a test gmail account and enable the APIs for it
* cover the following features:
    * send emails
    * search for specific messages in the mailbox, e.g. for keywords in subject or body text
* a brief documentation of your steps in terms what is needed to setup this API connection, PLEASE in your words not just copy & paste from google


### Remarks:
* well commented and easy to follow code
* please use only Python
* also a plus is to show some programming skills by using: classes, functions, etc.
* provide us runable code !


### Good luck and we are very excited to see your solutions! 

#### >> Next step in the interview process is then a personal meeting at our office.


### Note: We don't expect you to build THE solution or report here.
Our goal here is:
* see how you approach such a problem
* get an idea of your programming skills and tools you can use
* test your rational thinking in such a problem case
* see how you can summarize and present results

## Solution:
To set up the API connection for your app you need
- Google Account
- Enable Gmail API 
- Create credentials for the app.

All the steps for creating account is documentated in [Issue #1](https://github.com/y1450/hanselams-devop-challenge/issues/1).
Meanwhile the design is discussed in [Issue #2](https://github.com/y1450/hanselams-devop-challenge/issues/2).

To run the code,
you need to create a conda environment
```
conda create -n gmail_api python=3.10
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All the code  is contained in file `python main.py`
